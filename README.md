# âœ¨ Gekko
> ðŸ—‚ Managing Your School Is Now Easier Than Ever

Gekko is an open source project created for school districts, extra-curricular classes, and or other educational programs to communicate with students and guardians digitally.

## ðŸ“Œ Reasons we are different:

1. We are open source. Open source means that other developers can actively contribute and help with our application's development. This means we listen to our community

2. Gekko Support. We use github support as our primary feedback mechanism. We will change our application based on our user's responses.

# Techinical Details

1. Our frontend application uses [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and [Feathers Vuex](https://vuex.feathersjs.org) as our tech stack. Feathers vuex is the libary that allows us to easily connect with our [Feathers.js](https://feathersjs.org) backend API.

2. Our backend API uses [Feathers.js](https://feathersjs.org), a backend framework to easily create REST APIs, and MongoDB as our database choice. Here is the Github REPO to our [API](https://github.com/coderinblack08/gekko-api).
